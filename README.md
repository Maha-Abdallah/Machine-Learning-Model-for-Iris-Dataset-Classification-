**Machine Learning Model for Iris Dataset Classification**

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the "Machine Learning Model for Iris Dataset Classification" project! This project aims to showcase the application of two popular machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), for classifying the well-known Iris dataset.

**Table of Contents:**
1. **Introduction:** In this section, we provide an overview of the project, including the dataset used, the problem statement, and the objectives we seek to achieve through our machine learning models.

2. **Experiment Objective:** Here, we delve deeper into the specific objectives of our experiment. We outline the questions we aim to answer and the criteria we will use to evaluate the performance of our models.

3. **Why We Choose KNN And SVM:** In this section, we provide a rationale for selecting KNN and SVM as the two algorithms to build our machine learning models. We highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and explain how they are suitable for this particular classification task.

4. **Steps For Building ML Models:** This part presents a detailed step-by-step guide on how we prepared the data, split it into training and testing sets, and built the KNN and SVM models. We cover important considerations such as hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation techniques.

5. **Comparison And Result:** In this section, we showcase the results obtained from both the KNN and SVM models. We present a comprehensive comparison of their performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we visualize the results to gain deeper insights into their classification abilities.

6. **Conclusion:** The conclusion summarizes the key findings of our experiment, the strengths of each model, and any potential areas for improvement. We discuss the implications of our results and suggest possible future enhancements to the models.

**References:** We provide a list of the sources and references consulted throughout the project to ensure credibility and transparency.

We hope that this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in machine learning classification tasks, specifically with the Iris dataset. Feel free to explore the code, reproduce the experiment, and adapt it for your specific use cases.
